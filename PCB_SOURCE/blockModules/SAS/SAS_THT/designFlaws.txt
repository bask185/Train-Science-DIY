1. terminal connectors should be moved a few mm inwards so silk texts van be placed in front of them
2. The dc-dc converter needs slightly bigger holes, and it is currently mounted upside down
3. The bottem 90 degree connector should also be moved more inwards so an extension unit's PCB may be pressed against this PCB.
4. The detector connector is rather close to a screw terminal as well as on the config connector. The detector connector
  should have enough space for an extra pair of screw terminals.
5. Though no error, the transistors and the resistors can be housed under the arduino
6. It is a PITA to solder the miniscule transistor legs, it is better to use the larger footprint.
