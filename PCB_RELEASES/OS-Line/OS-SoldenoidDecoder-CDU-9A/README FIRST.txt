Important NOTE. THis design has not yet been prototyped. 
It only exists as a design. The design however does pass all design rule checks
and should just be just fine.

It also uses a different Software version for charging the capacitors.
This software is also finished, but it is not yet tested. It should however work just fine

If you are interested, contact me via contact form on train-science.com than we can make prototypes happen
